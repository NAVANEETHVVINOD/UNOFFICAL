🎯 13. FINAL NOTES AS A SENIOR DESIGNER

Your website will look like
a digital campus newspaper that comes alive.

LINKER — Senior UI/UX Engineer Deliverable

What you asked: a complete frontend feature idea, full visual design + SRS (software requirements specification) for the Retro-Newspaper redesign, and code-level starters. I used your new design brief (linkeddesign.txt) and the paper texture you uploaded.

Design reference & assets (local paths — use these as URLs in your build):

Design brief: ./linkeddesign.txt

Paper texture (background): apps/web/public/paper.png

1 — Executive Summary (One-line)

Redesign the LINKER web app into a single cohesive Retro Newspaper experience — a readable, tactile, doodle-driven campus platform that’s playful yet highly usable, mobile-first, accessible, and production-ready.

2 — Stakeholders & Users

Stakeholders: Project Lead (you), Students, Club Leads, Teachers, College Admin, Developers, Designers.
Primary Users / Personas:

Student Sam (18–22) — Wants quick event discovery, notes, marketplace.

Club Leader Lina — Needs to post events, recruit members.

Teacher Tara — Uploads materials, posts announcements.

Admin Ajay — Manages approvals and college settings.

3 — High-Level Goals & Success Metrics

Goals

Single hub for events, clubs, marketplace, notes; reduce reliance on WhatsApp.

Deliver a memorable brand: retro paper + doodles.

Mobile-friendly with quick discoverability.

Success metrics

DAU/MAU from pilot college (target 20% students in 1 month)

Time to find next event < 30s (first-time user)

Upload & publish workflow completion time < 2 minutes

4 — Scope & Constraints

In scope (MVP):

Home (newspaper hero), Events, Clubs, Marketplace, Notes, Profile, Login/Register, Dashboard.

Responsive (desktop/tablet/mobile).

Supabase/Postgres backend + Next.js frontend (as discussed) — backend API spec included below.

Paper texture background and doodle assets in public/doodles/.

Out of scope (phase 1):

Multi-tenant/white-label onboarding (phase 2).

Payment processing (optional later).

Realtime chat (phase 2).

5 — Functional Requirements (condensed)
5.1 Authentication & Roles

Sign up / sign in (email/password + college email verification via Supabase).

Roles: Student, Teacher, ClubAdmin, CollegeAdmin.

Role based content & admin approval flows.

5.2 Home (Hero + Highlights)

Newspaper hero with big title, tagline, CTA buttons (Explore Events, Clubs).

Feature strip (Events | Clubs | Marketplace | Notes) — interactive cards.

Campus Voice — pinned announcements.

5.3 Events

List (classified newspaper layout), event detail with date/time/location, RSVP/Bookmark.

Create/Edit event (ClubAdmin/Teacher).

5.4 Clubs

Directory grid/ads (newspaper ad style).

Club profile with description, upcoming events, member list, join button.

5.5 Marketplace

Listing CRUD (title, images, price, condition, contact).

Category filters, search, listing detail.

5.6 Notes & Materials

Upload PDFs/images, tag semester/department.

Search & download.

5.7 Dashboard / Profile

Personal feed (saved events, notes, postings).

Points/karma (optional later).

5.8 UX/UI Requirements

Paper texture global overlay (fixed) — small noise/halftone.

Doodles, tape, torn edges for cards.

Accessible color contrast and reduced-motion support.

6 — Non-Functional Requirements

Performance: Home LCP < 2.5s on mobile 3G simulated network (optimize images & lazy load).

Accessibility: WCAG AA for core flows; support keyboard and screen readers.

Security: Auth via Supabase; role checks server-side.

Maintainability: Single Next.js monorepo; component folder and tokenized Tailwind theme.

Scalability: Start single-tenant; database schemas support college_id for future multi-tenant.

7 — UI Design System (tokens + patterns)
Colors

ink: #000000

paper: #f9f4e8 (paper beige)

accentYellow: #FFE14D

accentBlue: #4DB0FF

Typography

Display: playful retro (Google: Permanent Marker or Freckle Face as fallback).

Body: Inter / DM Sans (readable).

Handwritten: Patrick Hand / Gloria Hallelujah for annotations & stamps.

Spacing / Grid

Container max width 1200px, gutter px-4.

12-column grid for desktop; collapse to single column at ≤ 768px.

Components (visual)

NewspaperCard — white panel, border: 4px solid #000, optional torn-edge.

Tape — static SVG overlay placed top/side.

RetroButton — black rectangle, white text, skew hover.

Doodle — SVG scanning with position props.

FeatureStrip — 4 panel horizontal band; mobile becomes horizontal scroll.

8 — Interaction & Motion

Use Framer Motion for gentle transitions: page enter fade+rotate, card hover rotate ±2°.

Tape wiggle: small rotation animation on mount and hover.

Respect prefers-reduced-motion.

9 — Accessibility rules (must)

Text contrast: base text on paper area must have sufficient contrast; avoid using yellow or blue for small body text.

Focus styles visible (thick black outline cut-style).

All interactive items should be reachable by keyboard (tab order logical).

Provide ARIA labels for cards/controls.

10 — Mobile Behavior

Columns collapse to stacked cards.

FeatureStrip becomes horizontally scrollable (snap).

Doodles scale down to 70% and become non-interactive.

Paper overlay blur slightly on mobile to improve text legibility.

11 — Content Strategy & Copy

Short, direct headlines (newspaper style).

Microcopy with handwritten feel for CTAs and tooltips (e.g., “Save this”, “Post this!”).

Use stickers/tape labels for statuses (New, Popular, Closing soon).

12 — ER / Data Model (simplified)

Tables (Postgres)

colleges — id, name, code, brand_meta

users — id, name, email, role, college_id, avatar, bio

events — id, title, body, start_at, end_at, location, tags, created_by, college_id

clubs — id, name, description, lead_id, college_id

notes — id, title, file_url, semester, department, uploaded_by, college_id

market_items — id, title, description, price, images[], condition, seller_id, college_id

bookmarks — id, user_id, target_type, target_id

Indexes: index on college_id, tags, start_at for events.

13 — API Spec (REST example)

Base URL: /api/v1

Auth: Authorization: Bearer <token>

POST /api/v1/auth/signup — {name,email,password,college_code}

POST /api/v1/auth/login — {email,password} -> token

GET /api/v1/events?college=xyz&tag=workshop — list events

GET /api/v1/events/:id — event detail

POST /api/v1/events — create (role check)

GET /api/v1/clubs?college=xyz

POST /api/v1/market — create listing

GET /api/v1/notes?department=CE&semester=3

POST /api/v1/upload — file upload (Supabase signed URL or S3)

Include server-side role validation for create/approve endpoints.

14 — Folder Structure (final monorepo focused on apps/web)

16 — Implementation Roadmap (week by week, 8 weeks MVP)

Week 0 — Setup & Clean Repo: remove unwanted files, add public/doodles/, wire globals.css and tailwind tokens.

Week 1 — Core UI system: Container, NewspaperCard, Doodle, RetroButton, basic hero layout.

Week 2 — Pages shell: Events list, Clubs list, Marketplace skeleton, Notes skeleton.

Week 3 — Auth & DB: Supabase integration, login/register UI.

Week 4 — CRUD: Events create/edit, Marketplace create, Notes upload.

Week 5 — Polishing: animations, tape/doodle placements, mobile optimization.

Week 6 — Accessibility & QA: contrast, keyboard nav, reduced motion tests.

Week 7 — Pilot Deploy & Feedback: deploy to Vercel; onboard small test group.

Week 8 — Iterate: fix issues, polish UX, prepare for phase 2.

17 — QA / Verification Checklist

Paper overlay loads and is fixed across breakpoints. (body::before)

Container prevents full-bleed on wide screens.

FeatureStrip horizontal scroll works on mobile, snap disabled for keyboard accessibility.

Doodles are SVGs and scale/position correctly.

Color contrast passes checks; yellow used for accents only.

prefers-reduced-motion respected.

Empty states use doodle + handwritten microcopy.

18 — Deliverables I’ll Provide If You Want (select any)

Full SRS PDF (formatted)

Figma file / wireframes (artboards for desktop/tablet/mobile)

Component library: full TSX files for all components & pages (ready to paste)

Doodle & tape SVG pack (black & white sketch style)

Demo preview (static deployable HTML + CSS on Vercel preview)

19 — Next Immediate Steps I recommend (I can do them now)

I can generate the complete component files for apps/web/app/components/ui/* and pages (Events, Clubs, Marketplace, Notes, Home) — ready for dev to paste.

I can create Figma-ready wireframes and a small doodle pack.

I can produce a single static preview page (deployable) showing the hero, feature strip, and one card style.

If you want me to start immediately, say which deliverables to generate first (pick any combination):

A — Component files (TSX)

B — Figma wireframes (SVG + layout)

C — Doodle & tape SVG pack

D — Static preview deploy page
